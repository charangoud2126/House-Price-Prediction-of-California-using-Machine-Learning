# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

A machine learning project that predicts house prices based on property features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other relevant attributes.
This project demonstrates end-to-end data science workflow including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

## Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately estimate house prices and help:

Real estate buyers make informed decisions

Sellers determine competitive pricing

Businesses perform property valuation analytics

## Dataset Features

The dataset includes important housing attributes such as:

Area / Size of the property

Number of bedrooms & bathrooms

Location-based factors

Property age and additional amenities

Target variable: House Price
