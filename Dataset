# Dataset

This project uses the **California Housing Dataset** provided by Scikit-learn.

The dataset contains housing-related information such as median income, house age, average rooms, population, and geographical location to predict median house prices.

It is fetched directly using:

```python
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing
data = fetch_california_housing()
